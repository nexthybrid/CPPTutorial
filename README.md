## Example 1 TicTacToe Game
A Tic Tac Toe game played in an executable file. Original version could be found at [C++ Tic Tac Toe Game](http://www.cppforschool.com/project/tic-tac-toe-project.html)
### If Conditions in C/C++
An effficient way to express if condition in one line:
`variable = Condition ? ResultForYes : ResultForNo`
![conditional expression](/pictures/Conditional-or-Ternary-Operator.jpg)

### Global Variables
A variable defined outside any functions is a global variable, and could be called within any function without declaring it as an explicit input

## Example 2 TicTacToe Game in Object-Oriented Mode
A Tic Tac Toe game written in object-oriented C++. Original version could be found at [Tic Tac Toe Object Oriented Programming C++](https://gsamaras.wordpress.com/code/tic-tac-toe-object-oriented-programming-c/). This original version was inspired by a homework assignment of a course at [ENGI 5895 Software Design](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~av/courses/5895-current/?page_id=24)
### Software architecture design diagrams
For better organization of large code projects, a good idea is to have a series of diagrams to assist the thinking process. UML(Unified Markup Language) comes helpful in this regard. A software MagicDraw focuses in this diagram-drawing capability, and provides easy drawing of Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, etc. The course at [ENGI 5895 Software Design](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~av/courses/5895-current/?page_id=24) provided examples of class diagram and sequence diagram for this Tic Tac Toe design.
### Note: Game not playing the grids properly, requires debugging

## Example 3 TicTacToe Game in Object-Oriented Mode v2
Another version of Tic Tac Toe game written in object-oriented C++. Original code could be found at [Hrittik16/TicTacToe](https://github.com/Hrittik16/TicTacToe).
